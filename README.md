ShopifyIQ is a spytool I built with my marketing business partner. I discovered that Shopify's APIs were fairly open, and leveraging this I could poll a store's products and understand which are the best sellers by rank. Doing this a few times a day would give me a snap shot of each products performance. Using this, I could determine the velocity of "winning products" coupled with data from our successful million dollar revenue stores.

This tool was instrumental in helping is not waste tens of thousands of dollar in testing products to sell, it would give us an insight others would not have and allow us to act quick.
